      <h4>Rotation 2: TechOps Operations Analytics Data Analyst Co-op</h4>I led
      the design and development of an automated TechOps Daily Performance
      Summary (TODPS) Report, streamlining the generation of visual insights for
      over 300 recipients every morning. I engineered several Python functions
      to produce tables, line graphs, and bar charts using Plotly and pandas
      Styler, ensuring clarity in tracking 50+ KPIs. To enhance usability, I
      structured and styled the visualizations with HTML and CSS. I also built
      the entire project framework, designing reusable functions and parameters
      for scalability.
