      <h4>Rotation 3: In-Flight Services Data Engineer Co-op</h4>
      For my 3rd rotation as a co-op at Delta Air Lines, As a Data Engineer
      intern on the In-Flight Services Operations Analytics team, I contributed
      three key functions to the operations utilities package, enabling over 20
      teams to access AWS Secrets Manager, load daily data into S3, and extract
      historical catering data into a DataFrame. I also migrated six jobs from
      AWS Glue to Lambda, optimizing cost and resource allocation. Additionally,
      I researched PySparkâ€™s multithreading capabilities to enhance the
      efficiency of over 520 ETL jobs.
