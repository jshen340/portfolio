      <h4>Rotation 1: TechOps Operations Analytics Data Analyst Co-op</h4>I
      built a project on nightly maintenance work packages, leveraging SQL to
      extract and structure data for enhanced insights. I designed and
      implemented a dual-chart visualization system in Tableau with dynamic
      filters. I also developed an automated 10-day heatmap using pandas and
      HTML, analyzing daily delay rates against pre-COVID benchmarks. In
      addition to the heat map, I programmed Gantt chart integration to
      visualize delay occurrences across stations.I delivered a department-wide
      presentation to TechOps OAP, demonstrating the impact of these insights to
      an audience of 25+ professionals.
